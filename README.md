#### National Public School, Rajajinagar
A student-teacher portal. One of its main features is a forum where students can ask their doubts, and the teachers can clarify them. Each student will have a unique account that is linked to the teachers handling the class (including the class teacher). The website will give a time-bound test each week, created by the teachers. The marks will automatically be calculated and shown. At the end of the allotted time, all of the students' marks will be submitted to their respective class teachers and they will be saved in a database, ready to access at any point of time. The teacher can search for the studentâ€™s marks by simply entering their name. The website will also have additional features such as report cards and leader boards.
